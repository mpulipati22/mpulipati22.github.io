The Dealer gets dealt two cards as well. However, one of the Dealer’s cards is face up.
The numeric cards are worth their respective values, while all face cards such as Jack, Queen, and King are all worth 10. Ace can represent either 1 or 11 depending on
what the player who has an ace chooses. </p><h2 class="big_blue" id="the-actions"> The Actions </h2><ul><li><strong>Hit: ask for another card</strong> <!-- -->- try it out below<!-- -->!</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Stay: hold your current total and end your turn</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Surrender: fold the hand</strong></li></ul><strong>If we’re playing for bets, then there are some additional actions:</strong><ul><li>Doubling down: Automatically hits another card and additionally doubles the current bet on the table</li><li>Splitting: can only be done with two cards of same value, and you split both of the cards into two separate hands.

After you examine your two cards, you can do the any of the actions described above. If you are not in risk of busting, then feel free to hit and inch closer to 21. 
If you are in risk of busting, then feel free to stay. After you have decided where you want to stop hitting, the Dealer plays until they hit 17. If you 
are in danger of losing the game through bets, you are welcome to surrender anytime. If you bust, dealer wins regardless of what hand they have.</p><p>And thats all! if you want more information about the game from the official Bicycle website, <em><a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/">click here</a></em></p><br/><a name="j2"></a><h2 class="big_blue" id="let’s-talk-probabilities"> Let’s Talk Probabilities </h2><p>Now that you know the rules, let’s get into probabilities. </p><strong>Hand probabilities:</strong><p>Using computer simulations, we can calculate the probabilities of busting in a round of blackjack based on the hand that you are dealt.</p><div></div><p>You can move the range slider to change the value of the total hand,
currently set to . The graph above visualizes 
all of these probabilites for you. Hover over the graph to see specific data points!</p><p>As you can see, a higher hand total in blackjack means a higher probability of busting; so be 
careful on hitting. A hand total of 21, attained through an ace and another face card, has a 100% chance of busting; meaning you automatically
win the round (unless the dealer also gets dealt 21 in which case you get your money back)</p><strong>Dealer vs Player probabilities:</strong><p>Lets get into some deeper strategy.</p><p>Now that we know probabilities of busting based on our own hand, we can explore strategies based on
the Dealer’s face up card. </p><p>Click the graph below to explore the players advantage and Dealer’s odds of busting based on the Dealer’s face up card.

This graph shows us the Dealer’s odds of busting based on their face up card. As a player, this is very important 
as we can increase our chance of winning by being confdent on betting based on the Dealer’s upcard. </p><p>As we can see, there is a general downward trend of Dealer’s odds of busting the higher their face up card is. Use this to your advantage to gauge
when you might hit or double down. </p></div><div style="display:none"><h3 class="big_blue_2" id="player’s-advantage">Player’s Advantage</h3><p>This graph shows us the Player’s advantage over the Dealer based on the Dealer’s face up card. </p><p>As we can see, there is a general downward trend of Player’s Advantage, even going into the negatives, the higher the Dealer’s face up card is.

As a player, your thought process should move in this order: </p><p><strong>Should I Surrender?</strong> - First of all, not all casinos offer a surrender option. If they do, surrendering is only available on the first turn -
before you are able to hit. Based on your hand totals, and the dealer’s upcard, if you see that your player advnatage is low, Surrender. You can always play the next hand. </p><p><div><div><div class="grid-container"><div> <img class="cards" src="./static/images/q1.jpg"/></div><div><br/><br/><h3 class="header1">Answer Choices</h3><label class="container1">Surrender<input type="radio" value="Surrender" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Hit<input type="radio" value="Hit" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Stand<input type="radio" value="Stand" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Double Down<input type="radio" value="Double Down" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Split<input type="radio" value="Split" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label></div></div></div></div><strong>Should I split?</strong> - Second, you should think about whether you should split. It is not always a good idea to split your hand when you are dealt a pair.
When given two ten-valued cards (ie a pair of anything from 10-K), it is a good idea not to split as you have a very close hand to 21 which most probably cannot be cracked.</p><p><div><div><div class="grid-container"><div> <img class="cards" src="./static/images/q1.jpg"/></div><div><br/><br/><h3 class="header1">Answer Choices</h3><label class="container1">Surrender<input type="radio" value="Surrender" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Hit<input type="radio" value="Hit" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Stand<input type="radio" value="Stand" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Double Down<input type="radio" value="Double Down" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Split<input type="radio" value="Split" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label></div></div></div></div><strong>Should I double?</strong> - After considering whether or not to split, you should think abotu a double. Some casinos do not offer the option to double on certain hands, so make sure you know those rules.
You should double on hands with a high player advantage percentage (again based on your hands and the Dealer’s upcard). Think about how likely it is that you will bust on a hit, and make the smart choice.</p><div><div><div class="grid-container"><div> <img class="cards" src="./static/images/q1.jpg"/></div><div><br/><br/><h3 class="header1">Answer Choices</h3><label class="container1">Surrender<input type="radio" value="Surrender" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Hit<input type="radio" value="Hit" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Stand<input type="radio" value="Stand" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Double Down<input type="radio" value="Double Down" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Split<input type="radio" value="Split" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label></div></div></div></div><p><strong>Should I hit or stand?</strong> - The last thing you consider is whether you hit a card or not. Obviously you already thought about this when considering whether to double donw or not,
however if you aren’t extremely confident about your advantage odds (or don’t want to blow your money in a gamble by doubling down), hitting or standing is the option.</p><div><div><div class="grid-container"><div> <img class="cards" src="./static/images/q1.jpg"/></div><div><br/><br/><h3 class="header1">Answer Choices</h3><label class="container1">Surrender<input type="radio" value="Surrender" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Hit<input type="radio" value="Hit" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Stand<input type="radio" value="Stand" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Double Down<input type="radio" value="Double Down" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label><label class="container1">Split<input type="radio" value="Split" name="radio"/><span class="checkmark"></span></label></div></div></div></div><a name="j4"></a><h2 class="big_blue" id="try-your-luck">Try Your Luck </h2><p>Its time for you to shine.
